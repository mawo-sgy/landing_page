    <h1>Mawo Gueye Sow</h1>
    <p class="intro">Hey there! I’m Mawo, a curious mind from Senegal, currently studying Computer Science in Algeria. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code, exploring AI, and constantly learning new things like web development and languages. For me, programming isn’t just a skill, it’s a way to express creativity and solve real problems.</p>

            <h2>🧑‍🎓 Study</h2>
            <p>I completed my Baccalaureate in Science with honors (Bien) and earned a scholarship to study in Algeria, where I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Boumerdès (UMBB). My journey in tech truly began after completing a Web Development Bootcamp, which deepened my passion for creating digital solutions and learning beyond the classroom.</p>

            <h2>🎯 Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of academics, I’m a naturally curious person who loves learning new things — from programming and languages to design. I also enjoy reading books, watching series, movies, podcasts, and anime, as they inspire me and broaden my perspective on creativity and storytelling.</p>

            <h2>💼 Experience</h2>
            <p>My experiences have taken me to the USA, Spain, and Algeria, each trip teaching me something new about people and culture. I’ve also completed an internship at AIBD (Dakar International Airport), where I discovered the importance of teamwork and professionalism. As a member of multiple student clubs, I’ve developed my ability to pitch projects, communicate ideas clearly, build relationships, and improve both my soft and technical skills through collaboration and community work.</p>
